## Description

* This Project was coded as part of the GWG Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

## Project Details

* In this project, we were given a static Restaurant Reviews webpage whose design was not responsive and which lacked accessibility. The task was to convert it  into a mobile-ready web application with the following criteria:<br>
The design  must be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.<br>
A Service Worker must be added in order to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the app's users.
