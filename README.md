## Description

* This Project was coded as part of the GWG Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

## Project Details

* In this project, we were given a static Restaurant Reviews webpage whose design was not responsive and which lacked accessibility. The task was to convert it  into a mobile-ready web application with the following criteria:<br>
The design  must be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.<br>
A Service Worker must be added in order to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the app's users.

## Running the Application

To run the app locally:<br>
* Download the repo as a .zip file or clone this project here:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/gerkill/gwg-fend-restaurant_reviews.git
    ```

* In this cloned folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this (and you don't even need to know Python). For most people, it's already installed on their computer.

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -v`. If you have Python 2.x, run the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000` (or some other port, if port 3000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 3000`. If you don't have Python installed, go to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, open the site: `http://localhost:3000`.
